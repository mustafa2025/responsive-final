            <strong>Kobe was named after a steak</strong> Kobe's father, Joe
            Bryant named his son after the expensive and known Japanese cut of
            beef, “Kobe Beef,” after seeing it on a menu. When he became known
            and his brand name blew up, Bryant sued the Japanese city of Kobe in
            2010, for the right to rename their signature product. While the
            city of Kobe had been around longer than him, he decided to sue it
            because he had become more famous and influential and his brand
            could easily be threatened.

            <strong>Lebron James is Ambidextrous</strong>
            James shoots primarily with his right hand but he is ambidextrous so
            can also shoot lefty. However, James only uses his left hand when he
            needs to, otherwise, he shoots righty. It's possible that no athlete
            has stood in a brighter spotlight from such a young age as four-time
            NBA MVP LeBron James. Ambidexterity, the ability to use both hands
            with near-equal dexterity, is one of the best skills to have as an
            NBA player.
