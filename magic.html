            Magic Johnson was born on 14th August 1959 and was schooled at
            Everett high school and Michigan State University. He was influenced
            by his parents who both loved basketball and grew up among his nine
            sisters and brothers. The love for basketball began for Magic
            Johnson since his upbringing to his infamous rivalry between Larry
            Bird and himself, but above all, Magic Johnson has never
            disappointed.
