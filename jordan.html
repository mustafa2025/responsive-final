            <strong>He Won a League Best 10 Scoring Titles</strong> In his 15
            seasons, MJ won an incredible 10 scoring titles, which is a league
            best. He also managed seven of these consecutively from 1986 to
            1993, with Wilt Chamberlain the only other player to manage this.
            Additionally, each year that the Bulls won the title, Jordan was
            also scoring champion that year. His highest scoring year was the
            1986/87 season, when he averaged a jaw dropping 37.1 PPG.

            <strong>Gambling is one of his hobbies</strong> Another of Jordan's
            well-known hobbies is his proclivity for gambling. Reports abound of
            how he goaded teammates into betting on almost every activity, from
            golf to card games to rock-scissor-paper throwdowns, but his desire
            to constantly up the stakes occasionally left him on shaky ground.
            For years a rumor persisted that his year off to play baseball was
            the result of a secret suspension imposed by NBA Commissioner David
            Stern.

            In 2020, it was revealed that Jordan has made more than one billion
            dollars from Nike. He also benefitted from the appreciation of NBA
            franchises after purchasing a majority share of the NBA's Charlotte
            Bobcats (now Hornets) in 2010. Long considered basketball royalty,
            Jordan now unquestionably gets paid like a king after cracking
