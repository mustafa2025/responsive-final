            <strong>Kobe was named after a steak</strong> Kobe's father, Joe
            Bryant named his son after the expensive and known Japanese cut of
            beef, “Kobe Beef,” after seeing it on a menu. When he became known
            and his brand name blew up, Bryant sued the Japanese city of Kobe in
            2010, for the right to rename their signature product. While the
            city of Kobe had been around longer than him, he decided to sue it
            because he had become more famous and influential and his brand
            could easily be threatened.

            <strong>Kobe Bryant scored 81 points in a game!</strong>
            He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007
            seasons. In 2006, he scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors,
            making it the second-highest number of points scored in a game in
            the history of the NBA. Unbelievable if you ask me.
